            Developing an integrated web portal for monitor the health and
            effectiveness of IIoT solutions developed by SAFEgroup. This project
            uses Role-Based Access Control with a modular template to allow for
            building a custom version on a {"customer's"} server. Created using
            Angular/TailwindCSS.
            <br />
            <br />
            Designed, programmed, and tested a solution that will be deployed at
            over 30 remote locations in Australia that will monitor the health
            of a solar/battery system and provide telemetry back to our servers
            using a micro controller, Satellite internet, and LoRaWAN.

            Conducted computer vision research as part of the Summer College of
            Science and Engineering Scholarship. Working with Dr Paulo Santos
            and PhD Candidate MaÃ«lic Neau. The focus of the research was
            improving scene graph data to create more practical Visual Question
            Answering models. The resulting paper has been published in Pattern
            Recognition Letters.
            <br />
            <br />I was awarded another scholarship to develop the AI
            interactions for a collaboration with Flinders University and
            Adelaide Fringe. The research included using a novel approach to
            coordinate multi-LLM interactions when operating in an environment
            with an audience and improv actors.
            <br />
            <br />I am currently collaborating with Cisco and the Innovation
            Centre Adelaide on a project for SA Ambulance Services regarding
            Vehicle telemetry.
