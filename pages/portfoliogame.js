        I created a portfolio game using Python that I&apos;m really proud of. The game is simple and consists of three unique rooms that showcase parts of my life experiences. It serves as an interactive resume.
        <br/><br/>
While working on this project, I gained a lot of experience in Python programming, including data structures, functions, and game design. I also learned about game development concepts such as collision detection, game logic, and game state management.
        <br/><br/>
The game has been a valuable addition to my portfolio, highlighting my programming skills and creativity. I wrote an article about the development process, which explains the technical details and design choices I made.
