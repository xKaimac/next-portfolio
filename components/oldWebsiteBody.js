                When I first began web development, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website. It was a fun project that allowed me to explore the basics of web development, but I knew I had more to learn.
            <br/><br/>
To take my skills to the next level, I decided to rebuild my site using React. React is a powerful JavaScript library that can help you build complex user interfaces, and it's used by some of the largest websites in the world. But before I did that, I wanted to showcase my old site on my new React website as a testament to how far I've come.
            <br/><br/>
To make this happen, I had to ensure that my old website was still accessible. I kept the old files and hosted them on a separate domain. On my new React website, I created a special section to display the old site, using an iframe element.
            <br/><br/>
An iframe element is a way to embed another web page within your own page. By simply adding an iframe element to my new site's HTML and pointing it to the URL of my old site, I was able to showcase the old site within my new site.
            <br/><br/>
Of course, the old site wasn't as fancy as the new one, lacking all the bells and whistles of a modern website built with React. However, it served as a great way to showcase where I started and how much I've progressed.
            <br/><br/>
Now, visitors to my new React website can see where I began and how my skills have improved over time. It's a testament to the power of learning and growing as a web developer.
            <br/><br/>
For those just starting out in web development, I encourage you to showcase your early projects. Doing so is an excellent way to demonstrate how far you've come and to inspire others to start their coding journey. And if you're ready to take your skills to the next level, consider learning React, a potent tool for building fast, efficient, and flexible websites.
